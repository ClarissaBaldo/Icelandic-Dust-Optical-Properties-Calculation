## Supporting research codes for Clarissa PhD thesis

The script **"Size_distribution_data_processing_12min"** contains the codes used to process GRIMM and SMPS measurements and merged these into a single size distribution with a time resolution of 12 min.

The script **"Aethalometer_corrections_2min"** contains the codes used to correct the aethalometer measurements and obtain the absorption coefficient with a time resolution of 2 min.

The script **"Measured_Bsca_Babs_Bext_SSA_data_processing_12min"** contains the codes used to correct nephelometer measurements and calculate the scattering, absorption, and extinction coefficients and the single scattering albedo with a time resolution of 12 min.

The script **"Calculation_SSA_average"** contains the codes used to estimate the experiment-averaged single scattering albedo based on the measured Mie coefficients.

The script **"Modelled_Bsca_Babs_Bext"** contains the codes used to model the scattering, absorption, and extinction coefficients based on the size distribution data and using Mie theory calculations.

The script **"Modelled_Bsca_7_170"** contains the codes used to model the scattering coefficients considering scattering angles from about 7ยบ to 170ยบ based on the size distribution data and using Mie theory calculations. 

The folder **"Retrival_k_n_SSA_average"** contains the codes used to retrieve the experiment-averaged complex refractive index (m=n+k):
**"Comparison_Bsca_avarage_calc_vs_meas_part1"**: comparison between the scattering coefficients modelled and measured. 
**"Comparison_Babs_avarage_calc_vs_meas_part2"**: comparison between the absorption coefficients modelled and measured.
**"Calculation_SSA_average_model_part3"**: retrieval of the experiment-averaged single scattering albedo.
**"Comparison_Bsca_Babs_SSA_average_part4"**: retrieval of the real part and imaginary part of the complex refractive index.
